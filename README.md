# RECA
Regional Regressions for Coastal Anthropogenic Carbon Estimations
We develop and generalize a Regional rEgression-based Coastal Anthropogenic carbon estimation algorithm (RECA) designed specifically for coastal environments. RECA builds upon the extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) framework, incorporating regional adaptations such as improved regression construction strategies, optimized data selection, and reduced subjectivity in decision-making, creating a unified approach applicable across diverse coastal settings.

In this file, we provided one file for the detailed **description of RECA** and one **example code of using RECA with CODAP-NA data**.

The detailed method explanation, validation, and comparison can be found in the published paper: (doi will be added after publication)
